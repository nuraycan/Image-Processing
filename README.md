In this project MATLAB codes are used.
This project is aim to count coins on a captured image by using image processing methods. We will try to find number of the coins and their total values.
The finding numbers of the coins is required the labeling and segmentation methods. 
So we should prepare our images for segmentation by doing preprocessing operations. 
After these processes we can get labels and objects. 
Then there would be so many methods to classify the coins but we prefer to use their areas in this project. 
The areas of the most coins are not same even if they are same kind of coin but their values  are close to each other. 
So we use this feature to define their types. 
As a result, after finding the numbers and types of the coins we can calculate the total values of them.
